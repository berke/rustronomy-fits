//! The `Fits` struct represents a FITS file containing (multiple) Header Data
//! Units (HDU's). Each HDU is decoded as a Rustronomy universal data container.
//! A `Fits` struct can be turned into a `Vec<HDU>` and vice-versa.
//!  
//! ## **H**eader **D**ata **U**nits
//! FITS Header Data Units or HDU's are mapped to Rustronomy universal data
//! containers when opening a Fits file. Header tags are automatically transformed
//! into Rustronomy's `MetaDataTag`-like tags.
//!
//! FITS's Random groups, Tables and Binary Tables are all mapped to a Rustronomy
//! Table. FITS's Image data type is mapped to Rustronomy's `DataArray<T>`. To
//! obtain a Rustronomy `Image<T>`, one can
//!
//! ## Decoding a FITS file
//! rustronomy-fits decodes FITS files HDU by HDU. FITS metadata tags are
//! automatically transformed to rustronomy metadata tags in this step. Not all
//! FITS metadata tags that were present in the FITS file are mapped to
//! rustronomy metadata tags. In particular:
//! - strings spanning multiple FITS tags are automatically combined into a
//! single tag
//! - FITS tags used only in decoding the file are not present in the rustronomy
//! HDU (examples are BITPIX and the NAXIS tags)
//! - FITS tags that correspond to restricted rustronomy tags are mapped to those
//! tags, rather than general metadata ones.
//!
//! All FITS arrays are mapped to NDArrays of the appropriate type, conserving
//! FITS's column-major layout.
