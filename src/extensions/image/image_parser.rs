            I decided to tune the maximum buffer size with the fits_bench.rs

            Conclusion: This limit does not matter **at all*
            Reason: the buffer is heap-allocated, which means that cache optimi-
            zations don't work.
            RFC #1909 will implement this feature in the future, so I'll leave
            the code intact for now...
